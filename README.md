# Leetcode Account Script

This script gets the details of LC accounts I have.

## How to use?
Clone the repo 
```
git clone git@github.com:RunAtTekky/LC_Script.git
```

Create a file `leetcode_accounts.txt` with the username name on each line.

An example is `RunAtMe`

Make sure python is installed
```
python3 script.py
```

Now this will output the results into `LC_account_details.txt`
